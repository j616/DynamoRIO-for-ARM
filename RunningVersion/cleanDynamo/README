About DynamoRIO

DynamoRIO is a runtime code manipulation system that supports code
transformations on any part of a program, while it executes. DynamoRIO
exports an interface for building dynamic tools for a wide variety of uses:
program analysis and understanding, profiling, instrumentation,
optimization, translation, etc. Unlike many dynamic tool systems, DynamoRIO
is not limited to insertion of callouts/trampolines and allows arbitrary
modifications to application instructions via a powerful IA-32/AMD64
instruction manipulation library. DynamoRIO provides efficient,
transparent, and comprehensive manipulation of unmodified applications
running on stock operating systems (Windows or Linux) and commodity IA-32
and AMD64 hardware.

Quickstart instructions for running DynamoRIO:

--------------------------------------------------
On Linux:

32-bit:
  % bin32/drrun -client samples/bin32/libbbsize.so 0x1 "" ls
64-bit:
  % bin64/drrun -client samples/bin64/libbbsize.so 0x1 "" ls
For additional options:
  % bin32/drrun

For full control over child processes use a two-step process:
first configure with bin32/drconfig and then invoke the parent
process with bin32/drinject.

--------------------------------------------------
On Windows, with examples run from a cygwin shell (for cmd shell replace
the first slash with a backward slash: e.g., bin32\drrun.exe):

Method 1: directly invoke an application:
32-bit:
  % bin32/drrun.exe -client samples/bin32/bbsize.dll 0x1 "" calc
64-bit:
  % bin64/drrun.exe -client samples/bin64/bbsize.dll 0x1 "" calc

Method 2: configure an application and launch it separately.
This requires administrative privileges:
32-bit:
  % bin32/drconfig.exe -reg calc.exe -syswide_on -client samples/bin32/bbsize.dll 0x1 ""
64-bit:
  % bin64/drconfig.exe -reg calc.exe -syswide_on -client samples/bin64/bbsize.dll 0x1 ""
Now run the application however you normally would, with the mouse or from
the command line:
  % cmd /c start calc

Now close calc and a messagebox should pop up produced by the bbsize client.
