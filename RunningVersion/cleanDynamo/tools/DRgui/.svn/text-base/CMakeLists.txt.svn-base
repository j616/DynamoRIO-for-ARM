# FIXME i#77: make DRgui a subproject to support with different compiler from libutil
# For now, DRgui.exe just won't run on NT.
#
# PR 232385: for release packages we want DRgui.exe to run on NT,
# which means we cannot build using VC71 or VC80, as their MFC
# versions add dependencies on libraries like shlwapi.dll and ole*.dll
# that are not present on NT.  So we build using VC60.
# Unfortunately with VC60 we can't make a debug build as libutil uses
# VC71 and we can't incorporate the policy_staticd pdbs.
