\page page_drsyms Symbol Access Library

The \p drsyms DynamoRIO Extension provides symbol information.  Currently
it is only available for Windows PDB symbols but Linux and Cygwin support
is in the works.

 - \ref sec_drsyms_setup
 - \ref sec_drsyms_api
 - \ref sec_drsyms_write

\section sec_drsyms_setup Setup

To use \p drsyms with your client simply include this line in your client's
\p CMakeLists.txt file:

\code use_DynamoRIO_extension(clientname drsyms) \endcode

That will automatically set up the include path and library dependence.

The \p drsyms library on Windows relies on the \p dbghlp.dll library from
Microsoft.  You will need to download the Debugging Tools for Windows
package from http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx
and place the \p dbghelp.dll in the same directory as either \p drsyms.dll
or as your client library.

More recent versions of \p dbghlp.dll on Windows can use significant
amounts of stack space.  We recommend raising the stack size when using \p
drsyms on Windows from the default 20KB to 36KB via the DynamoRIO runtime
option <tt>-stack_size 36K</tt>.

\section sec_drsyms_api API

All functions return a success code of type #drsym_error_t.

Prior to use, \p drsyms must be initialized by a call to drsym_init().  
The \p drsyms API will eventually support both sideline and online use, and
the parameter to drsym_init() will specify the symbol server to use for
sideline use.  Today only online use is supported and \p NULL should be
passed.

Symbol lookup is supported in both directions: from an address to a symbol
via drsym_lookup_address(), and from a symbol to an address via
drsym_lookup_address().  All symbols in a given module can be enumerated
via drsym_enumerate_symbols().

For an example of usage see the \p instrcalls sample client distributed
with DynamoRIO.

When finished with the library, call drsym_exit().

\section sec_drsyms_write Console Writing

The \p drsyms Extension also provides convenience routines for printing to
the \p cmd window, which DR's dr_printf() and dr_fprintf() are unable to do
(Issue 261).  Use drsym_write_to_console() to write to any kind of window,
and drsym_using_console() to determine whether inside a "console" or \p cmd
window.

Unfortunately there are significant limitations to this console
printing support:

 - It does not work from the exit event.  Once the application terminates
   its state with csrss (toward the very end of ExitProcess), no output
   will show up on the console.  We have no good solution here yet as exiting
   early is not ideal.
 - It does not work at all from graphical applications, even when they are
   launched from a console.
 - In the future, with earliest injection (Issue 234), writing to the
   console may not work from the client init event.
